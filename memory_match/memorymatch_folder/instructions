You have 16 cards and each one has a pair, it would be 8 cards with pairs. The pair of cards will have the same image, that is because we need to know when you win a pair. 
1. The objective of the game is to collect the most pairs of cards by remembering where they are
2. Shuffle the cards and lay them on the table, face down, in rows of four.
